# Project Rules

## Architecture

- This is a **frontend-only service** built with Next.js
- All API calls must be made to external backend services
- Do not implement backend logic, database connections, or server-side business logic in this codebase
- This service acts as a client that communicates with separate backend/API services

## Application Context

- This is a **fintech application**

## API Integration

- All API endpoints should be configured to point to external services
- Use environment variables for API base URLs and endpoints
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Consider rate limiting, retry logic, and timeout handling for external API calls
